 👋 Hey! my names Brett Davies. I was an automation specialist working for a systems integrator in Colorado. I programmed Human Machine Interfaces, Programmable logic Controllers, Remote Terminal Units, and made sure these all talked with our robotics and electrical devices. I would write Python scripts for fun to automate processes and then stumbled upon Full-Stack Development when our company transitioned to a new piece of inventory/ time tracking software. I found ways that we could improve the functionality as well as accessibility. I knew immediately that I was more drawn to Full-Stack Software Engineering over my current career at the time. I have since moved onto Software engineering and couldn’t imagine doing anything else.
 
 👀 I’m interested in books, fitness and nutrition, hiking, and spending time with family and friends.
 
🌱 I’m currently learning and improving OOP to help make my code more precise 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with smart folks that are passionate about building and improving digital content
